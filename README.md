# psf-gsoc-fedibot

A bot for Python-GSOC's Fediverse presence.

Making it easier to keep track of our participants, and inviting both participants and mentors to engage more in the community. Plus, it's written in Python! We figure we should be able to hack on our own infrastructure, in the project language.

## Features

- Keep track of participants' regular posts
- Link participants, projects, and mentors
- Produce reports
- Promote projects?

## Contribute?

We're not really ready for outside contributions yet; so far, this is a proof of concept more than anything else. This project is run by [Ben](https://social.python-gsoc.org/@ben) in spare time.
